# aux

To simplify scripting access to multiple machines, we present here a simple API
that makes running commands on a POSIX compliant system, either local or
remote, nothing short of a breeze.

Remote commands are run via ssh, and the aux binary can work as a proxy script,
that enables an administrator to granulate access control.
